# EDR, MDR and XDR

EDR, MDR and XDR are three emerging endpoint security technologies built to provide greater visibility, threat detection and response across all corporate endpoints.

## Endpoint Detection And Response (EDR)
Traditional endpoint security is reactive and detects potential security threats by matching known signatures and attack patterns. EDR, on the other hand, is predictive and focuses on identifying advanced persistent threats and never-before-seen malware that are designed to evade traditional security defenses. Most EDR solutions leverage the combined power of cyber threat intelligence, machine learning capabilities and advanced file analysis to help detect advanced threats.

EDR solutions record and store queries, behaviors and security events, allowing cybersecurity teams to detect and analyze suspicious activities over time. In case of a breach or detection, EDR will contain the malware by isolating it and will understand its behavior by detonating the malicious file in a safe environment (i.e., sandbox). EDR will also help conduct an extensive root cause analysis and aid with faster incident response.


## Extended Detection And Response (XDR)

XDR is a more evolved, holistic, cross-platform approach to endpoint detection and response. While EDR collects and correlates activities across multiple endpoints, XDR broadens the scope of detection beyond endpoints and analyses data across endpoints, networks, servers, cloud workloads, SIEM and much more. This provides a unified, single pane of glass view across multiple tools and attack vectors. Out-of-the-box integrations and pre-tuned detection mechanisms across multiple different products and platforms help improve productivity, threat detection and forensics.


## Managed Detection And Response (MDR)

MDR is not technology, but a form of managed service, sometimes delivered by a trusted MSSP (managed security service provider). MDR provides great value to organizations that either have limited resources or lack the expertise to continuously monitor potential attack surfaces. MDR services are not defined by technology, but instead by specific security goals and outcomes. MDR providers usually include a host of cybersecurity tools such as endpoint detection, SIEM, network traffic analysis, User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA), asset discovery, vulnerability management, intrusion detection and cloud security.
